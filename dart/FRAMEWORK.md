# Basic Syntax and Usage of 'test' for TDD in Dart

This tutorial will introduce you to the basic syntax and constructs needed to start writing unit tests with Dart's `test` package, which is commonly used for Test-Driven Development (TDD). We'll guide you through setting up a basic unit test scenario using `test`, making this tutorial ideal for beginners looking to incorporate unit testing into their Dart projects.

**For further in-depth information, you can refer to the following resources:**

### Understanding the test package

Dart's `test` package provides a way to write and run tests within the Dart environment. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the test from the reporting framework.

### Key Components

1. **Test Case Structure:**
   In Dart, a test is structured using the `test()` function, where each test is encapsulated within it.

```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';

void main() {
    test('calculates Fibonacci numbers', () {
        expect(fibonacci(5), equals(5));
    });
}
```

2. **Assertions:**
   The `test` package facilitates a range of assertion methods such as `expect()` and `equals()`, essential for verifying test outcomes.

```dart
expect(result, equals(expected));
```

This method confirms that the outcome from a function aligns with what is expected.

### Example: Testing a Fibonacci Sequence Function

To demonstrate, we'll set up a test for a function that computes Fibonacci numbers.

1. **Implementing the Function:**

   Define a function that calculates a Fibonacci number recursively:

```dart
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

2. **Writing Tests:**

   Create a unit test that verifies the `fibonacci` function:

```dart
void main() {
    test('calculates Fibonacci numbers', () {
        expect(fibonacci(5), equals(5));
    });
}
```

### Running Tests

Execute the tests by saving your script as `test_fibonacci.dart` and running this command in the terminal:

```bash
dart test test_fibonacci.dart
```

### Breakdown of the Test Case

- **Test Method:** `"calculates Fibonacci numbers"` executes the `fibonacci` function with a specific input and validates the result with `expect(equals())`.

### Conclusion

Through this tutorial, we reviewed how to use Dart's `test` framework. We covered the creation of a test case, assertions, and a simple practical example. The `test` package's built-in features support robust test construction and can help improve the reliability of software by catching issues early in the development cycle.
