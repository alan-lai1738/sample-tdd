# Basic Syntax and Usage of unittest for TDD in Dart

This tutorial will introduce you to the basic syntax and constructs needed to start writing unit tests with Dart's `test` package, which is commonly used for Test-Driven Development (TDD). We'll guide you through setting up a basic unit test scenario using `test`, making this tutorial ideal for beginners looking to incorporate unit testing into their Dart projects.

**For further in-depth information, you can refer to the following resources:**

- Dart's `test` package documentation: https://pub.dev/packages/test

### Understanding the test package

Dart's `test` package provides a way to write and run tests within the Dart environment. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the test from the reporting framework.

### Key Components

1. **Test Case Structure:**
   In Dart, a test case is created using the `test()` function. Each test is defined within this function.

```dart
    import 'package:test/test.dart';

    void main() {
        test('sums numbers', () {
        expect(sum([1, 2, 3]), equals(6));
    });
}
```

2. **Assertions:**
   The `test` package provides a number of assertion methods like `expect()`, `equals()`, etc.

```dart
    expect(result, equals(expected));
```

This method is used to check that the result you received matches the expected result. It is central to setting up test conditions.

### Example: Testing a Simple Addition Function

To illustrate, let's write a simple test for a function that sums a list of numbers.

1. **Implementing the Function:**

   Create a simple function outside of the test suite to sum numbers:

```dart
    int sum(List<int> numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((value, element) => value + element);
}
```

2. **Writing Tests:**

   Implement a unit test to ensure that the `sum` function works as expected:

```dart
    void main() {
        test('sums numbers', () {
        expect(sum([1, 2, 3]), equals(6));
    });
}
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests, if you save your script as `test_sum.dart`, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
    dart test test_sum.dart
```

### Breakdown of the Test Case

- **Test Method:** `sums numbers` calls the `sum` function with a specific list of numbers and checks that the result is correct using `expect(equals())`.

### Conclusion

Through this tutorial, we reviewed how to use Dart's `test` framework. We covered the creation of a test case, assertions, and a simple practical example. The `test` package's built-in features support robust test construction and can help improve the reliability of software by catching issues early in the development cycle.
