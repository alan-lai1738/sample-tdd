# Introduction to the TDD Practice Project

This project is designed as an educational resource to familiarize you with Test-Driven Development (TDD). It begins with a rudimentary project structure that merely contains the basic architecture: a main program, a function declaration for conversion processes, and a couple of preliminary unit tests. These elements establish a foundational framework that encourages learning and applying TDD principles hands-on.

The repository organizational structure is delineated by programming languages. The languages available are [**C#**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/csharp), [**Java**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/java), [**C++**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/cplusplus), [**Python**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/python), and [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/javascript)

Each language-specific directory contains two crucial documents:

- **README.md:** Provides a general overview of that particular language's sub-codebase, guiding you through the basics and specific configurations tailored to the language.
- **FRAMEWORK.md:** This document serves as a tutorial explaining the main unit testing framework utilized by that language, offering both insights and step-by-step guidance on effective usage.

# Detailed Instructions for Project Completion:

Each language-specific sub-folder contains its own `README.md` file, which details step-by-step instructions on how to proceed with the assignments. These instructions are tailored to the specifics of each programming environment and testing framework, providing a clear path from setup to execution.

### [C#:](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/csharp)

- **Unit Testing Framework:** The project leverages xUnit, a popular choice for unit testing in C# applications, thoroughly documented by Microsoft: [Unit Testing with xUnit.net and .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test).

### [Java:](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/java)

- **Unit Testing Framework:** JUnit is utilized, a staple for Java developers, integrated through Apache Maven. Additional detailed information can be found in Maven’s official guide: [Getting Started with Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).

### [C++:](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/cplusplus)

- **Unit Testing Framework:** The project utilizes doctest, a light, fast, and open-source testing framework for C++. Additional extensive documentation is readily accessible here: [doctest documentation](bit.ly/doctest-docs).

### [Python:](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/python)

- **Unit Testing Framework:** Python's native `unittest` library supports the TDD approach in this project. Additonal comprehensive information is available on Python’s official documentation site: [unittest — Unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

### [JavaScript:](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/tree/readme-update/javascript)

- **Unit Testing Framework:** JavaScript's `jest` library supports the TDD approach in this project. Additonal comprehensive information is available on their official documentation site: [jest — Unit testing framework](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

# Additional Learning Resources:

Beyond the core instructional content, two PDF documents are provided to enhance your understanding and application of unit testing concepts:

- [**PRIMER.PDF:**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/blob/readme-update/PRIMER.pdf) This document is derived from discussions with students who have previously engaged with this assignment, offering practical insights and firsthand experiences. A continiously-updated version of this as a [Google Document can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uxb2fVq267BSKKTXfm6147A4C6zFFDlfIKALhYliaSc/edit?usp=sharing)
- [**UNITTESTING.PDF:**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/blob/readme-update/UNITTESTING.pdf) Contains supplemental information that expands further on unit testing techniques and best practices.
